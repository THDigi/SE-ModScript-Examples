# Examples

A collection of SE mod script examples and some ready-to-use code libraries.

I recommend to start from [Quick Intro to Space Engineers Modding](https://github.com/THDigi/SE-ModScript-Examples/wiki/Quick-Intro-to-Space-Engineers-Modding) which is in the Wiki tab with other guides aswell.

Feel free to use these scripts in free mods.

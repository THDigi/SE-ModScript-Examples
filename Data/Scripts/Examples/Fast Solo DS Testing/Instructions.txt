For fast solo DS testing you don't really need to re-publish the mod every time in order to update it,
 you can simply update the files that are on your machine.

Obviously this will only work for you, and anyone else joining the server will download the mod from workshop.

To use this:
1. Copy the .bat file in this folder to your mod script folder (e,g, ...\Mods\PaintGun.dev\Data\Scripts\PaintGun\*.bat).
2. Open the .bat file with a text editor.
3. Change the WORKSHOP_ID to the mod's workshopID number.
4. Change MOD_SCRIPT_PATH to the last folder in Scripts (e.g. PaintGun from my above path).
5. Change STEAM_PATH to the Steam library that the game is installed in.

Now you can run it every time you want to update the mod on DS and client.
